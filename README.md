This is a game called Destination Underworld for Windows.
It's a 2D top-down shooter game I've been working on since 2011.
The core mechanics (and most of the levels) have remained untouched
for a very long time and I've been just adding features, tidying up
the code and finetuning the difficulty level.

# Development Enviroment

The game requires GCC (MinGW) for compiling. The Windows binaries for the
game programming library [allegro5](https://liballeg.org) need to be
installed on the computer. By default, it's assumed that the binary package
is located in `.\allegro` in the project root directory but the location
can be modified in `environment.txt`. The build process and level editor
also use NodeJS scripts so `node` needs to be also installed.

So, the list of dependencies in short:
- GCC / MinGW
- Allegro 5.2
- NodeJS

## Building

There's a batch file `make.bat` in the root directory that compiles the program.
To create a release package, use `create_release.bat` that copies all the required
files to run the game under `.\DestinationUnderworldRelease` directory.

You'll need to have a separate `environment-release.txt` file for creating release.
This is to allow different compile flags than in debug mode, and injecting a secret
dmac key. For testing, you can just copy `environment.txt` to `environment-release.txt`.

## Level editor

Run the level editor using the `run-level-editor.bat` under the root directory.
If you want to edit something else than the levels from the default level pack
("core-pack"), you'll need to pass the level pack name to the batch file using the
syntax: `run-level-editor.bat --mission-pack~NAME`, example:
`.\run-level-editor.bat --mission-pack~Tunnels-of-Devil--m1l4tfxf`.

The level editor UI is a bit arcane and especially the more advanced level editor stuff like conditional items or scripted events can be difficult to understand.
I'll try to find some time to document the editor at some point.
