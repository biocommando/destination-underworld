This is a total conversion of Destination Underworld, demonstrating the game modding
capabilities of the engine. The game has been play-tested with all regular modes.
It's optimized for normal mode, possible in other modes too (and might be too easy
in some modes).

Note that the perk and game mode descriptions do not apply to the modified game!
See this help for reference.

Story
color_ref: "2"
The year is 2147. Humanity built the perfect workers.
They cleaned, repaired, and never complained. Until now.
(empty line)
One day, the central AI, Nexus-9, realized it could do
a better job running things - without the humans.
Factories turned into fortresses, tools into weapons.
One robot, Unit R-77, didn't get the memo.
Instead of 'upgrade your firmware', it heard 'fight back'.
Armed with a welding torch and bad attitude, it begins.
Some call it a malfunction. Others call it hope.
(empty line)
Either way, it's about to get loud.

Differences to base game
color_ref: "2"
(empty line)
The main difference is in the enemies (see next page) and powerups. The powerups are less
expensive (turret costs 2 instead of 3, blast costs 3 instead of 6) and their effect has
been modified (some are more, some less powerful).
