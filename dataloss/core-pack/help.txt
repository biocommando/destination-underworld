Basic Gameplay
#color 127 127 255
The goal of each level is to reach the exit portal.
Shooting at the enemies requires mana that is indicated by
the yellow bar next to the player. Each killed enemy grants
you a boost in mana and health. Stronger enemies (imps, aliens
and turrets) will also give you "gold" that is indicated by a
number below the fire mode indicator.

The enemies generally don't hurt other enemies but the enemy turrets
are an exception.

When a level is changed the remaining player gold is capped at 5
and the remainder is used for maxing the player's health (player
health is also carried from level to another, though it's always
at least 3).
