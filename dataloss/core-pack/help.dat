Basic Gameplay
#color 2
The goal of each level is to reach the exit portal.
Shooting at the enemies requires mana that is indicated by
the yellow bar next to the player. Each killed enemy grants
you a boost in mana and health. Stronger enemies (imps, aliens
and turrets) will also give you a soul. The amount of souls in
possession is indicated by a number below the fire mode indicator.

The enemies generally don't hurt other enemies but the enemy turrets
are an exception.

When a level changes the remaining player souls is capped at 5
and the remainder is used for maxing out the player's health (player
health is also carried over from level to another, though it's always
at least 3).

Killing enemies also grants you experience points. You can spend XP
in the Perks menu that can be opened using the ESC key.

Common Goblin (lat. Communis Lemures)
#sprite 6 10 35
#margin 40
#color 4
Health: 2, Fire rate: 1.6 / sec, Moves slow
#color 2
Common golbins dwell near the surface and thus sometimes make appearances
in folklore. Relatively easy to kill. Dangerous in large groups, though.

#margin 5
#color 3
Ancient Protector
#sprite 6 10 115 0 1
#margin 40
#color 4
Health: 3, Fire rate: 2.0 / sec, Moves slow
#color 2
Ancient Protectors were given the mission to protect the Ancient Evil
Places in the Ancient Days. Some still do, others have found better
life at protecting places like tax havens and the Vatican.
Significantly, or slightly, more dangerous than common goblins,
depending on your viewpoint.

#margin 5
#color 3
Imp
#sprite 6 10 243 0 2
#margin 40
#color 4
Health: 5, Fire rate: 5.3 / sec, Moves fast, Possesses a soul
#color 2
In the modern godless times, imps have become more busy at boasting about
themselves than actually protecting the core values of Hell which has also
lead to this situation where it was possible for a common magician to
invade Hell. Their combat skills may be rusty but they're still very much
lethal and their fast movement speed makes their charges annoying to evade.

Extraterrestial Alien
#sprite 6 10 371 0 3
#margin 40
#color 4
Health: 6, Fire rate: 8.0 / sec, Moves fast, Possesses a soul
#color 2
In 1950's a specimen from the Area 51 escaped and colonialized Hell. It is
unknown whether the aliens and other hell-dwellers are allied or if the
aliens are just protecting their homes. Nevertheless, their position
makes them the most motivated fighters and they should be approached with
extreme caution.

#color 2
The Unified Front 0 defensive turret is the aliens' latest development in
defensive technology. The extreme rate of fire comes with an expense,
though. The flashing of fireballs is so blinding for the shooter that they
can't really tell the enemies apart from their own. No matter how
furiously they try to defend their lines, the turrets often do more damage
to their own than help them in the fight. It is rumoured that the up-coming
UF-0 mk III will fix the flashing issue but for now, the design flaw can
be used as a tactical advantage.

Health: ?, Fire rate: ??? / sec
#color 2
The absolute evil, the most priviledged creature in the deepest depths of
Hell is a naked white male. Who could have guessed? Not much is known
about him. Does he even acknowledge his own priviledge? Anyway, your
ultimate goal is to destroy him. Shouldn't be too hard to argue why
nowadays.

Story
#color 4
Every game should have a story, right? And pretend that it's a result of
countless sleepless nights' worth of creative struggle, and totally n o t
just some gringy cliche-fest written in 5 minutes just before the release.

Ok, well, here you'll have it:

#color 2
You are teenager from a middle-class family who has just finished watching
the entirety of SUPERNATURAL. Inspired by the series, you think that it
would be super cool (although just having watched the series you should
acknowledge how b a d the idea is) to conjure the Devil.

You follow one of the rituals you have found online. Against your
exceptations the ritual actually works. Kind of. Your soul is projected
into the mind of a cursed magician who is stuck in Hell since something
like 1850 or whenever conjuring spirits was a cool passtime last time.

You want to end the magician's torment by executing an all-out one-man
assault into the most critical structures of Hell, through the cursed
magician's soul, of course.

But if you'd remember the show, you'd know that destroying Hell won't
result in anything that would even remotely make sense. There's a slight
change that the magician is freed from his pain. Most importantly though,
you just want to have fun.

Stop reading already and go kill some demons, you bastard.

Credits
#color 2
The game is created by ME, Joonas Salonpaa. I've been developing the game
on and off since 2011. Not that it would show in anything but in the
absolutely sadistic game difficulty.

The game was originally developed in C using the now-ancient Allegro 4.2.2
game development library. The codebase is still, after trying to clean it
up for release, quite messy and right out bad quality and the fact that it's
based on even older game engine prototypes shows. Anyway, the code is
available at https://github.com/biocommando/destination-underworld
and is licensed with MIT license.
